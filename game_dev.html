		<t2>I am designer based out of Grenaa, Denmark. I focus on both 2D and 3D graphic design. I have been modelling cars the last 3 years for GTA mods. I have also been making liveries for cars in GTA for just over 5 years. I have recently been trying my hand at Blockbench making models for Minecraft.</t2>
		<t2>
I am currently for the next 2 years attending a multimedia designer education at Dania in Grenaa, Denmark. I have yet to figure out exactly what I want to work with within design, though I do know what I am good at and what I am less good at.</t2>
		<t2>I have professional experience as both a shop worker (just under 2 years) and a themepark ride operator (8 months as of November 2024).</t2>
